## Our Wedding Weekend
We are excited to welcome you all to our fun-filled wedding weekend! Washington is our new home and we are looking forward to creating new memories with all of you.

Islandwood is a 255-acre non-profit outdoor learning center that strives to inspire lifelong environmental and community stewardship. We have exclusive use of the whole property throughout the weekend - we think it's a pretty special place and we can't wait for you to see why!

## The Event
Expect an action-packed weekend of s’mores, dancing, shenanigans, friends old and new alike, nature hikes, romance, suspension bridges, and more.

The main event will be held Saturday afternoon and evening - but we're planning a full weekend of activities starting on Friday evening that we’d love to see you all at. We invite you to make IslandWood your home for the weekend and pack in as much fun as possible. We can't wait to celebrate with you!

There are activities all weekend long on IslandWood’s campus. All are welcome to join in on the fun, beginning Friday evening and ending Sunday morning.
